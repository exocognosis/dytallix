# Root genesis signing (three of five)

Production activation v1, step A2. A production node opens a chain only from
a root genesis signed by three of the five genesis signers (P01, 30 September
2026, `launch/approvals/P01_E05_ACTIVATION_2026-09-30.json`). This page is
the signers' procedure with the offline signer,
`consensus/root-authorization/cmd/dytallix-root-sign`. It does not appoint
signers or authorize a launch. Root signers sign only after the P02 review,
E06 release acceptance and gate acceptance.

## What is signed

The root bundle binds four files:

- the native genesis;
- the application configuration;
- the engine genesis (by SHA-512);
- the release manifest (by SHA-512).

Every signer signs one genesis envelope over the bundle's SHA-512: the chain
ID, action `genesis`, sequence 1 and heights 0 to 0. The signature is
SLH-DSA-SHAKE-256s, 29,792 bytes, under the root action context
`DYTALLIX/ROOT/v1/genesis`.

## Public records

Both records are public and canonical JSON. Publish them with the network
configuration and give every node the same bytes.

| Record | Contents |
| --- | --- |
| Signer policy | Schema 1, the chain ID, five keys `{key_id, public_key_hex}` sorted by key ID, threshold 3. `key_id` is the lowercase SHA-256 of the public key. |
| Signatures | Schema 1, the chain ID, the bundle SHA-512 and three to five `{key_id, signature_hex}` entries sorted by key ID. |

The node keeps its receipt in consensus state, and the receipt lists the
signing key IDs and the signatures file's SHA-256. Every node must therefore
read the same combined file. Two different valid files (for example three
signatures and four) start two different chains.

The genesis signers are a separate group: their keys must not hold an
emergency, upgrade or handover role. The node refuses to open a chain whose
genesis signer policy shares a key with any of them.

## Procedure

Each signer works on their own device. Private keys never leave it and never
enter this repository, the custody packet or a ticket.

1. **Key.** Each signer generates a key once, in the approved key ceremony:

   ```text
   dytallix-root-sign keygen -private-key-out signer.private -public-key-out signer.json
   ```

   It writes the 128-byte private key (mode 0600) and the public key record,
   and prints the key ID. Back up the private key under the custody
   procedure. Hand over only `signer.json`.

2. **Policy.** The custody lead assembles the five public records for the
   chain, and every signer checks that their own key ID is listed. The
   [genesis signer intake](../../../launch/custody/genesis/INTAKE.md) checker
   emits the same policy, byte for byte, once the signers' records are
   complete and separate from the emergency and upgrade custodians:

   ```text
   dytallix-root-sign policy -chain-id CHAIN -out policy.json a.json b.json c.json d.json e.json
   ```

3. **Digest.** Each signer recomputes the bundle digest from the published
   genesis files. They compare it, and the four file digests it prints,
   with the published build manifest:

   ```text
   dytallix-root-sign digest -native-genesis native-genesis.json -config application-config.json \
     -engine-genesis genesis.json -release-manifest RELEASE_MANIFEST.json
   ```

4. **Sign.** Each signer signs with their own key. The signer refuses a key
   outside the policy, and a private key file readable by anyone but its
   owner:

   ```text
   dytallix-root-sign sign -policy policy.json -private-key signer.private \
     -bundle-sha512 DIGEST -out signer-signature.json
   ```

5. **Combine.** Anyone can merge three to five signature files and verify
   them. Publish the result:

   ```text
   dytallix-root-sign combine -policy policy.json -out root-genesis-signatures.json s1.json s2.json s3.json
   dytallix-root-sign verify -policy policy.json -signatures root-genesis-signatures.json -bundle-sha512 DIGEST
   ```

## The node

The operator's root configuration (`consensus_stdio --root-config`) names:

- the pinned helper and its observed execution policy;
- the two public records;
- the engine genesis and release manifest files, with their SHA-512 digests.

On every start, including restart, the node:

1. checks both records;
2. hashes the actual files;
3. rebuilds the bundle;
4. verifies every listed signature through the pinned `dytallix-root-verify`
   (helper wire version 2), one run per signature.

Any refused signature stops the start. At InitChain it commits a version 2
receipt:

- scope;
- the policy SHA-256;
- the threshold;
- the signing key IDs;
- the bundle SHA-512;
- the envelope and signatures SHA-256.

A later start compares that receipt byte for byte.

## Not covered here

- Appointing the genesis signers and their custody records.
- The key ceremony and proof of possession.
- Backup, replacement and recovery procedures.
- The chain ID and the published network configuration.

These are custody and launch records (D10-Q03, D14-Q03). Records stay in the
custody system; only public keys, key IDs and digests enter this repository.
