# DEPRECATED - Use UNIFIED_PORT_CONFIG.md

This file has been replaced by [UNIFIED_PORT_CONFIG.md](./UNIFIED_PORT_CONFIG.md) which contains the comprehensive, conflict-free port configuration for all Dytallix Fast-Launch services.

## ⚠️ Important Migration Notice

The port assignments in this file were causing conflicts. All services have been migrated to a new unified scheme:

- **Frontend**: 3000 (unchanged)
- **Backend API**: 3001 (was 8787) 
- **QuantumVault API**: 3002 (was 3031)
- **Blockchain Node**: 3003 (was 3030)
- **WebSocket**: 3004 (was 9000)

## 📋 Next Steps

1. Use the new [UNIFIED_PORT_CONFIG.md](./UNIFIED_PORT_CONFIG.md) as the single source of truth
2. Update any external documentation referencing the old ports
3. Restart all services to pick up the new port configuration
